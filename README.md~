# iMLCP (Interactive MLCP Shell)

iMLCP is an interactive shell for MarkLogic Content Pump.

Author: mattsun


## Features

* Run any command of MLCP. Use iMLCP same way as mlcp.sh if you are already familiar with it
* Interactive (Read-Eval-Print Loop)...
* Auto-completion: MLCP command, options, frequently-used value (true, false, xml, ...) and system path
* Command history (hit up arrow)
* Run any system shell command
* Easy to deploy
* Get rid of many existing system shell limitations, include but not limit to:
  * No automatic path expanding limitation of system shell (which may cause 'Argument too long' error)
  * No need to use double quote to enclose some fields (Eg. -delimiter "|", since vertical bar has special meaning in system shell)
  * A easy replacement of options_file in some cases (Eg. use tab as delimiter and contains space in csv header)
